Slides for BISC 305
===================

Introduction to Statistics for Biologists
-----------------------------------------

This is the LaTeX source for slides for the second half of BISC 305, at USC in Fall of 2013.

They may also appear as html, linked to from [this page](http://petrelharp.githug.io/bisc305/outline.html), at some point in the future.

These omit many illustrations and exercises done on the board.
