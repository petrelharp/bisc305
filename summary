INFORMAL SUMMARY + HOMEWORK

* Correlation & Causation
**   confounding factors
* t test
**   one-sided or two-sided?
**   7.4.2: confounding factors
**   7.4.8: correlation is not causation
**   7.5.1: two-sample t-test
* signficance and importance
**   effect size
**   CIs
**   P-value, sample size, power
**   7.6.1: significant and/or important?
* conditions
**   test statistic; under null model
**   if they are wrong then P-values are wrong and/or test has lower power
**   for t-test: random, independent samples; sampling distribution of the means close to Normal.
**   7.8.2: why not t-test?
**   7.9.1: interpret hypothesis test
* wilcoxon-mann-whitney
**   distribution-free
**   versus power
**   7.10.4: do WMW
**   7.10.6: do and interpret WMW
* paired-sample t
**   difference to unpaired t test
**   increased power
**   8.2.2: do paired-sample t, CI
**   8.2.3: ditto
* paired-sample sign test & Wilcoxon sign-rank test
**   procedure for each; zeros, ties
**   conditions, differences
**   8.4.3: sign test
**   8.4.11: sample size for power in sign test? (hard)
**   8.5.4: sign-rank test
* estimating proportions
**   CLT for frequencies
**   Wilson's estimator and SE
**   and CI
**   picking sample size for estimation of proportion
**   9.2.2: SE for proportion
**   9.2.9: sample size for estimation
**   9.2.10: continued
* chi-squared for proportions
**   omnidirectional
**   parking lot example
**   9.4.1: test to given proportions
**   9.4.6: again
* two-sample chi-squared
**   contingency tables
**   motivation: conditional prob in columns 
**   df
**   conclusions depend on nature of data: one big sample or columns are different samples?
**   conditions: independence
**   10.2.1: make fake data with chisq = x
**   10.2.5: do chisq
* ANOVA
**   means across multiple groups
**   variance within to variance between
**   11.2.1: find SS, MS...
**   11.2.7: invent data with within=0, between=0
* F test and two-way ANOVA
**   partition of sum of squares
**   anova model
**   F statistic
**   factorial, two-way design
**   beak size x island example
**   two-way anova model
**   test for no interactions
**   11.4.5: one-way ANOVA
**   11.7.1: graph two-way data
**   11.7.2: continue, do F test for interactions and one effect; estimate SD
* correlation and coefficient
**   toxoplasma example
**   r and what it means
**   linear!
**   hypothesis test for rho=0
**   12.2.1: identify r
**   12.2.5: compute, test, interpret correlation
**   12.2.6: again
* least-squares regression
**   usc temperature example
**   equation for regression line 
**   residual SS and SD
**   proportion of variance explained
**   12.3.3: do regression etc
**   12.3.6: again
* linear model, regression
**   linear model
**   random subsampling model (conditions)
**   SE for slope
**   testing the slope
**   nonlinearity
**   outliers
**   leverage points
**   influential points
**   clustering; nonindependence
**   residuals versus predicted
**   12.4.3, 12.4.4: prediction and SD
**   12.5.3: CI for slope
**   12.6.2: sample size and certainty of slope
**   12.6.6: identify residual plots (+ interpret!)
