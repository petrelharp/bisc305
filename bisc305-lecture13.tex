\section{Association and Causation}

\begin{frame}{What happens in a study}

    \alert{Question:} Does $X$ affect $Y$?

    \vspace{2em}

    To find out, we take some samples, recording:
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item explanatory variable(s) ($X$)
          \item response variable(s) ($Y$)
      \end{enumerate}
    and the typical value of $Y$ seems to depend on $X$.

    \vspace{2em}

    \ldots but then, what do we conclude?

    \vspace{2em}

    \alert{It depends} on how we take the sample.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: hematocrit}

    \alert{Hematocrit} measures concentration of red blood cells in blood.
    Are sex differences caused by androstenedione?

\subsection{Experimental vs.\ Observational studies}

\begin{frame}{There's more to an experiment than observation.}

  \begin{block}{How to do an observational study}
    \alert{Observe} (measure) something about an existing situation.
  \end{block}

  \vspace{2em}

  \begin{block}{How to do an experimental study}
    Observe (measure) something
    from groups whose \structure{differences} were \alert{chosen} by you.
  \end{block}

  \vspace{2em}

  \alert{Easy way to get experimental:}
  Randomly assign to treatment and control groups.

  \vspace{2em}

  \begin{quote}
    In an \textbf{experiment}, the researcher manipulates the experimental conditions,
    \textbf{defining} the populations being compared.
  \end{quote}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Observation versus experiment}

  Is it an observational study or an experimental study?
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item How were the samples obtained?

    \item Who is in the treatment and the control groups? \\
      \alert{or} Does the researcher assign the explanatory variables?

    \item Who is being studied?

  \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{The difference}

  In \alert{both} observational and experimental studies,
  the conclusion is generally ``$X$ is associated with $Y$'' (or not).

  \vspace{2em}

  \ldots but in an \alert{experiment},
  there are a lot fewer ways to explain the association.

  \vspace{2em}

  \structure{Example:}
  \begin{description}
      \item[Study 1:] Children of smokers have lower birth weight.
        \pause
      \item[Study 2:] We got a randomly chosen half of our sample to start smoking,
          and their children had lower birth weight.
  \end{description}

  \end{center}

  \vspace{2em}

  \alert{Why not?}

\end{frame}

%%%
\subsection{Confounding factors}

%
\begin{frame}{Confounding factors}

If we are looking for the effect of $X$ on $Y$,
the factor $Z$ is \alert{confounding} if $Z$ is known to have an effect on $Y$,
and $X$ might be associated with $Z$.

\vspace{2em}

If association between $X$ and $Y$ only happens because of $Z$:
\[
  X \sim Z \longrightarrow Y
\]
then the association is \alert{spurious}.

\vspace{2em}

\alert{Solution:} control for $Z$.  (can be difficult)

\vspace{2em}

\structure{Study 2':} We got 159 pairs of women,
    each matching in many ways, except one of the pair quit smoking before the second pregnancy.
    Those who quit had heavier children.

\subsection{Unpacking the terminology}


%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Interpreting results}

  % \begin{quote}
  %   \textbf{Results:}
  %   According to pairwise analysis, the active twins had lower body fat percentage ($P=0.029$) and homeostatic model assessment index ($P=0.031$) and higher Matsuda index ($P=0.021$) compared with their inactive co-twins.  Striatal andprefrontal cortex (subgyral and inferior frongal gyrus) brain gray matter volumes were larger in the nondominant hemisphere in active twins compared with those in inactive co-twins, with a statistical threshold of $P<0.001$.

\section{Describing real-world importance}

%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Significant or important?}
    \vfill

    So you have a \alert{tiny $P$-value}.

    \vfill

    How big is the effect?

    \vfill
    \pause

    \structure{Or,} I believe your result is not noise,
    but how much \alert{do I care?}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{It's significant, but is it important?}


    \begin{block}{the difference in means}
        We've observed a difference between two populations:
        \[  \bar y_1 - \bar y_2 \]
    \end{block}

    \ldots and got a small $P$-value.  So what?

    \vspace{2em}

    \structure{Ask yourself:} What do we want to know?\\

    \vspace{2em}

    How important is the observed difference?


\end{frame}


%%%%%% %%%%%%
\subsection{The effect size}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}

    \begin{block}<1->{the $t$-statistic}
        \begin{align*}
            t_s = \frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \SE_{\bar Y_1 - \bar Y_2} } 
            = \frac{ \text{(actual difference)} }{ \text{(magnitude of sampling noise)} }
        \end{align*}
        is big if the observed difference is large compared to the estimated size of the \alert{estimation error}.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}<2->{the effect size}
        If both populations have the same SD, $\sigma$,
        \begin{align*}
            \text{(Effect size)} = \frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \sigma }
            = \frac{ \text{(actual difference)} }{ \text{(magnitude of within-population variation)} }
        \end{align*}
        is big if the observed difference is large compared to \alert{within-population variation}.
    \end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Examples}
    In each, 
    what are the $t$-statistics
    and the effect sizes?
    What do they tell us?

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{crr}
       & Males & Females \\

       $s$ & 35 & 34

%%%%%% %%%%%%
\subsection{Using confidence intervals}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Significantly unimportant?}

    The \alert{confidence interval} describes where we are pretty confident the true value lies.

    \begin{itemize}

    \item So if we think an effect smaller than $x$ is \alert{unimportant}
      and $x$ is outside the confidence interval,

    \item then we have good evidence the true effect is unimportant.
      (inconsequential, insignificant, \ldots?)

    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{2em}

    Examples:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Lactate dehydrogenase levels:
      \item Body weight:
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Interpret:}

  \begin{quote}
    ``Our data also suggest a positive association of cigarette smoking and new HPV detection (OR, 3.4; 95\% CI, 0.4--26.3); {however, because 87\% of study participants were smokers, we had limited power to detect significant effects.}''
  \end{quote}

  \vspace{2em}

  OR = ``odds ratio'' = increased odds of contracting HPV

\end{frame}


%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Not significant, but important?}

    Recall that ``not signficant'' means
    \begin{quote}
        there was not sufficient evidence that the observed difference was due to anything other than chance variation.
    \end{quote}


    \vspace{2em}

    This does \alert{not} mean that there is no real difference!

    \vspace{2em}

    If the confidence interval includes zero, but also some big (important) values,
    then we don't have the \alert{power} to tell.  
    Here ``not significant'' reflects our uncertainty.
