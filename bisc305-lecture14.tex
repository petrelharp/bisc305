\begin{frame}{Statistical significance}

    \begin{quote}
        the difference was \only<2->{\alert{statistically} }significant \\

    \structure{means}
    \begin{quote}
        we found good evidence that the difference in sample means was not caused by chance variation alone
    \end{quote}

    \structure{or more precisely}
    \begin{quote}
        if the null hypothesis was true, we'd expect to see at least this large a difference no more than 5\% of the time
    \end{quote}
    }

\end{frame}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Lack of statistical signficance}

    \begin{quote}
        the difference was \alert{not} significant (with $P>0.5$)
    \end{quote}

    \uncover<2->{
    \structure{means}
    \begin{quote}
        there was not sufficient evidence that the observed difference was due to anything other than chance variation

\section{Describing real-world importance}


%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{It's significant, but is it important?}


    \begin{block}{the difference in means}
        We've observed a difference between two populations:
        \[  \bar y_1 - \bar y_2 \]
    \end{block}

    \ldots and got a small $P$-value.  So what?

    \vspace{2em}

    \structure{Ask yourself:} What do we want to know?\\
    How important is the observed difference?


\end{frame}


%%%%%% %%%%%%
\subsection{The effect size}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Effect size}

    \begin{block}<1->{the $t$-statistic}
        \begin{align*}
            t_s = \frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \SE_{\bar Y_1 - \bar Y_2} } 
            = \frac{ \text{(actual difference)} }{ \text{(magnitude of sampling noise)} }
        \end{align*}
        is big if the observed difference is large compared to the estimated size of the \alert{estimation error}.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}<2->{the effect size}
        If both populations have the same SD, $\sigma$,
        \begin{align*}
            \text{(Effect size)} = \frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \sigma }
            = \frac{ \text{(actual difference)} }{ \text{(magnitude of within-population variation)} }
        \end{align*}
        is big if the observed difference is large compared to \alert{within-population variation}.
    \end{block}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Examples}

  The \alert{effect size} is a good descriptive statistic.

  \vspace{2em}

  Examples:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lactate dehydrogenase levels:
    \item Body weight:
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%% %%%%%%
\subsection{Using confidence intervals}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Significantly unimportant?}

    The \alert{confidence interval} describes where we are pretty confident the true value lies.

    \begin{itemize}

    \item So if we think an effect smaller than $x$ is \alert{unimportant}
      and $x$ is outside the confidence interval,

    \item then we have good evidence the true effect is unimportant.
      (inconsequential, insignificant, \ldots?)

    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{2em}

    Examples:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Lactate dehydrogenase levels:
      \item Body weight:
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Interpret:}

  \begin{quote}
    ``Our data also suggest a positive association of cigarette smoking and new HPV detection (OR, 3.4; 95\% CI, 0.4--26.3); {however, because 87\% of study participants were smokers, we had limited power to detect significant effects.}''
  \end{quote}

  \vspace{2em}

  OR = ``odds ratio'' = increased odds of contracting HPV

\end{frame}


%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Not significant, but important?}

    Recall that ``not signficant'' means
    \begin{quote}
        there was not sufficient evidence that the observed difference was due to anything other than chance variation.
    \end{quote}


    \vspace{2em}

    This does \alert{not} mean that there is no real difference!

    \vspace{2em}

    If the confidence interval includes zero, but also some big (important) values,
    then we don't have the \alert{power} to tell.  
    Here ``not significant'' reflects our uncertainty.

\begin{frame}{Tomato yield}

    Comparing the yield of two tomato varieties,
    a mean difference of 1 pound per plant is ``important''.

    \vspace{2em}

        95\% CI & significant? & important? \\
        \hline
        0.2 -- 0.3 & & \\
        1.2 -- 1.3 & & \\
        0.2 -- 1.3 & & \\
        -0.2 -- 0.3 & & \\
        -1.2 -- 0.3 & & \\

\begin{frame}{Summary}

    When communicating numerical results using statistics:
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item Always think about what you are trying to learn,
          \item what you have learned about, 
          \item and what is still uncertain.
      \end{enumerate}
      (Sometimes you have to do this for others' results as well.)


    \vspace{1em}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Statistical signficance \alert{does not imply} real--world significance.
        \item Lack of statistical signficance \alert{does not imply} real--world insignificance.
        \item Sample size acts like a magnifying glass, making smaller differences visible.
        \item The \alert{effect size} is the difference in means as a proportion of the within-population variability, and is
          a good way to describe the scale of the difference.
        \item Confidence intervals are a good way to assess both statistical signficance and real--world importance.
    \end{enumerate}
