\section{Measuring real--world significance}


%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{It's significant, but is it important?}


    \begin{block}{the difference in means}
        We've observed a difference between two populations:
        \[  \bar y_1 - \bar y_2 \]
    \end{block}

    \ldots and got a small $P$-value.  But, do we care?

    \vspace{2em}

    \structure{Ask yourself:} What do we want to know?

\end{frame}


%%%%%% %%%%%%
\subsection{The effect size}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Effect size}

    \begin{block}<2->{the $t$-statistic}
        \begin{align}
            t_s = \frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \SE_{\bar Y_1 - \bar Y_2} } 
            = \frac{ \text{(actual difference)} }{ \text{(magnitude of sampling noise)} }
        \end{align}
        is big if the observed difference is large compared to the estimated size of the \alert{estimation error}.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}<3->{the effect size}
        If both populations have the same SD, $\sigma$,
        \begin{align}
            \text{(Effect size)} = \frac{\bar y_1 - \bar y_2}{ \sigma }
            = \frac{ \text{(actual difference)} }{ \text{(magnitude of within-population variation)} }
        \end{align}
        is big if the observed difference is large compared to \alert{within-population variation}.
    \end{block}

\end{frame}


%%%%%% %%%%%%
\subsection{Using confidence intervals}

%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Significantly unimportant?}

    The \alert{confidence interval} describes where we are pretty confident the true value lies.

    \vspace{2em}

    So if we think an effect smaller than $x$ is \alert{unimportant}
    and $x$ is outside the confidence interval,

    \vspace{2em}

    then we have good evidence the true effect is unimportant.
    (inconsequential, insignificant, \ldots?)


    \vspace{2em}

    Example:

\end{frame}


%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Not significant, but important?}

    Recall that ``not signficant'' means
    \begin{quote}
        there was not sufficient evidence that the observed difference was due to anything other than chance variation.
    \end{quote}


    \vspace{2em}

    This does \alert{not} mean that there is no real difference!

    \vspace{2em}

    If the confidence interval includes zero, but also some big (important) values,
    then we don't have the \alert{power} to tell.  
    Here ``not significant'' reflects our uncertainty.

\begin{frame}{Tomato yield}

    Comparing the yield of two tomato varieties,
    a mean difference of 1 pound per plant is ``important''.

    \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
        95\% CI & significant? & important? \\
        \hline
        0.2 -- 0.3 & & \\
        1.2 -- 1.3 & & \\
        0.2 -- 1.3 & & \\
        -0.2 -- 0.3 & & \\
        -1.2 -- 0.3 & & \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
    When doing statistics:
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item Always think about what you are trying to learn,
          \item what you have learned about, 
          \item and what is still uncertain.
          \item Always say what you mean.
      \end{enumerate}
      (Sometimes you have to do this for others' results as well.)


    \vspace{2em}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Statistical signficance \alert{does not imply} real--world significance.
        \item Lack of statistical signficance \alert{does not imply} real--world insignificance.
        \item \alert{Never} call the result of a statistical test ``insignificant''.
        \item The effect size is a good way to measure the real-world impact of a difference in means.
        \item Confidence intervals are a good way to assess both statistical signficance and real--world importance.
    \end{enumerate}
