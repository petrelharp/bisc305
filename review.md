General principles:
===================
* always look at, and think about, the data
* correlation is not causation (consider confounding factors)
* sample size is like a magnifying glass, it lets you see smaller effect sizes
* ... but statistical significance does not imply real-world importance
* statistical (hypothesis) tests have two pieces: a test statistic, and a null model
* the P-value is the probability of seeing a test statistic at least as extreme under the null model
* nonindependent observations can drastically mislead you
* if the sampling distribution is not close to Normal, use a distribution-free test


Tests:
======
* two-sample t-test
* Wixocon-Mann-Whitney
* paired-sample t
* paired-sample sign
* Wilcoxon sign-rank
* CI for estimated proportion
* chi-squared for single-sample proportions
* two-sample chi-squared
* F-test for one-way ANOVA
* F-test for two-way ANOVA
* t-test for no linear correlation

What you should know for each test:
===================================
* what sort of data the test applies to
* what conditions the test needs to be appropriate
* how to check the conditions are satisfied
* how to formulate the null & alternative hypotheses
* what the test statistic is and how to compute it
* how to interpret the result, statistically, and in real-world terms

Other concepts:
===============
* standard deviation of --
* standard error of --
* effect size (of difference in means)
* back-calculation of necessary sample size to have power to see a certain effect (e.g. for differences in proportion)
* the two-way ANOVA model: group means, interaction means, plus noise/variability
* correlation: proportion of variance explained
* the linear (regression) model: linear conditional men plus noise/variability
* regression: residuals, leverage, influence
