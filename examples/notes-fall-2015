"To test the causal role of the pMFC in adherence to group and religious ideologies, we
applied TMS or sham stimulation followed by a 10-minute filler task to ensure that down-
regulation of the pMFC took effect. We then primed all participants with thoughts of death using
a brief writing task, followed by a self-report affect schedule to assess potential effects of TMS
on conscious emotion. Next, participants were asked to read essays (one critical of the United
States, one complimentary) ostensibly written by immigrants to the U.S., then evaluate the
authors’ personalities and attitudes, a dependent measure frequently used to assess ethnocentrism."

Psychedelics and Mental Health: A Population Study
  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063972
"Data drawn from years 2001 to 2004 of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health consisted of 130,152 respondents, randomly selected to be representative of the adult population in the United States"
" 21,967 respondents (13.4% weighted) reported lifetime psychedelic use. There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, lifetime use of specific psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote), or past year use of LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health outcomes. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with lower rate of mental health problems.  "

"In females, all treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls, and more rapidly."
"After mean survival time had elapsed, any deaths that occurred
were considered to be largely due to aging. Before this period,
30% control males (three in total) and 20% females (only two) died
spontaneously, while up to 50% males and 70% females died in
some groups on diets containing the GM maize (Fig. 1)."

http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2456122
"The latest study, is the first randomized control trial [224 subjects] to explore the effect of moderate wine consumption--no more than a single five-ounce serving per day--with alcohol abstention over a lengthy period.

Study participants were all alcohol abstainers at the outset of the study. And all maintained a Mediterranean-style diet throughout their participation, ensuring that the consumption of red wine, white wine or mineral water was the principal difference in their diets.
