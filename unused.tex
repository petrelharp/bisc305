        Fifty-six of 96 tumor specimens showed altered p53 expression.  The patients with altered p53 expression survived for a significantly shorter period after surgery than those without p53 expression, (P = 0.02, [...] Wilcoxon test).

    Recorded survival times for 56 patients with altered p53 expression and 40 patients without;
    did a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test comparing the two groups.

        DNA methylation level is [a property of sites in the genome, and is] displayed as beta-values ranging from 0--1. 
        To identify consistently differentially methylated CpG sites [in the genome] Wilcoxon rank sum paired test was performed for normalized beta-values of paired twins.
